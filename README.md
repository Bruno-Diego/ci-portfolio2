## Supported Screens and Browsers

## Deployment

## Supported Screens and Browsers

- The website is fully responsive and can be accessed on smartphones (width of 600px and smaller), tablets (width of 820px and smaller) and monitors of any size.

- The website was tested and is supported on the browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Brave.

## Deployment

The master branch of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.

## Via Gitpod

The project deployment was based on the [Code Institute Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

  - Click the `Use This Template` button.
  - Add a repository name and brief description.
  - Click the `Create Repository from Template` to create your repository.
  - To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`, this can take a few minutes.
  - When you want to work on the project it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod (rather than Github) as this will open your previous workspace rather than create a new one. You should pin the workspace so that it isn't deleted.
  -  Committing your work should be done often and should have clear/explanatory messages, use the following commands to make your commits:
    - `git add .`: adds all modified files to a staging area
    - `git commit -m "A message explaining your commit"`: commits all changes to a local repository.
    - `git push`: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.
  - You can view the website in a browser by using the command `python3 -m http.server` and clicking on the button `Open Browser` on the box that will pop up.

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

  1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
  2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
  3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

  1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
  2. Press the arrow on the Code button
  3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
  4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
  5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied on GitHub
  6. Press enter and your local clone will be created.

## Via Github Pages

  - The live website was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  
    1. Log in to GitHub
    2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
    3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click `Settings`
    4. Select `Pages` on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
    5. In the source section, select branch `Master` and save
    6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following:

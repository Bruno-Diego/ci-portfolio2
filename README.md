## UX

## Purpose of the project

Welcome fellow visitor,

This is the CI Snake Game Website. Our goal is to give the user a game that can be both challenging and fun!

This website is made of the following sections:

  1. Title.
  2. Instructions to play the game.
  3. Gaming area.
  4. On-screen controls.
  5. Feedback area.
  6. Social media links.

The business goals for this website are:

  1. To give the user a fun and challenging game.
  2. To get user feedback about the game.

The target users are:

  - People of all ages.
  - Interested in playing a game that is challenging and fun at the same time.

What these users would be looking for:

  - A game that can be played to pass time without being too stressful.
  - A game with multiple levels of difficulty to be challenging.
  - A game that can be played using the keyboard or the on-screen commands.
  - A funny game to play with the option to provide feedback.

The user interested in play this game can see from the title that it's a snake game. Immediately the user can find the instructions to play the game when the page is loaded. The user is presented with the options to change the speed of the game between Low, Average and Fast. The Standard option is Slow but it can be changed at any momment before the game starts or during the gameplay. The user can choose to use his own keyboard or the on-screen buttons to move the snake on the gaming area. Below the controls buttons, the user can see a presentation paragraph and a form to send feedback to the website's creator. At the bottom of the page, the user can access the links for social media.

The following features will be included in this release:

  - Title
  - Instructions for the user about how to play the game.
  - Options to change the speed of the game.
  - Gaming area.
  - E-mail contact form.
  - Links to social media pages.


This website was crafted using semantic HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for stylings and presentation and Javascript for dynamic and interactive content. It was created to give birth to the Second "Portfolio Project" to complete as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course at Code Institute in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. 

For better UI/UX, a modern and simple interface is used with a well-defined title, spaced letters with good contrast for a cool reading and colors based on a forrest pallette uniformized in the entire website.

The layout has an intuitive structure with the title at the top, the footer at the bottom and the content in the area in between. The styling is consistent through all pages. Links to the social media are styled to have an animated fade when when hovered upon and also open in a new tab.

The footer contains icons for Facebook, Instagram, Github and LinkedIn, which link as expected to the website's and the creator's accounts on the respective platforms. The website is fully responsive and can be accessed on many different screens and is compatible with the most used browsers.

## Features



### Future features


## Typography and color scheme

- The main font used on the website was `Raleway` from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. [Source](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=Raleway#about).

- The colors on the website are inspired by a Forrest/Bamboo Palette created on [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) with multiple shades of greens to inspire a natural vibe in the user.

## Wireframes

This website was first planned from scratch on Balsamic Wireframes with the license provided by the Code Institute. [Click here](./assets/docs/snake-game-wireframes.pdf) to see the wireframes of the raw project.

Please note the actual website has changed slightly from these wireframes.

## Technologies Used

## Code validation 

## Test cases


## Fixed bugs


## Supported Screens and Browsers

## Deployment

## Supported Screens and Browsers

- The website is fully responsive and can be accessed on smartphones (width of 600px and smaller), tablets (width of 820px and smaller) and monitors of any size.

- The website was tested and is supported on the browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Brave.

## Deployment

The master branch of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.

## Via Gitpod

The project deployment was based on the [Code Institute Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

  - Click the `Use This Template` button.
  - Add a repository name and brief description.
  - Click the `Create Repository from Template` to create your repository.
  - To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`, this can take a few minutes.
  - When you want to work on the project it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod (rather than Github) as this will open your previous workspace rather than create a new one. You should pin the workspace so that it isn't deleted.
  -  Committing your work should be done often and should have clear/explanatory messages, use the following commands to make your commits:
    - `git add .`: adds all modified files to a staging area
    - `git commit -m "A message explaining your commit"`: commits all changes to a local repository.
    - `git push`: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.
  - You can view the website in a browser by using the command `python3 -m http.server` and clicking on the button `Open Browser` on the box that will pop up.

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

  1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
  2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
  3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

  1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
  2. Press the arrow on the Code button
  3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
  4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
  5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied on GitHub
  6. Press enter and your local clone will be created.

## Via Github Pages

  - The live website was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  
    1. Log in to GitHub
    2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
    3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click `Settings`
    4. Select `Pages` on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
    5. In the source section, select branch `Master` and save
    6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following:
